# Experiments 
This section contains all the notebooks and scripts for the visualizations, smoothness calculations, and some early work on interpretability (which was discontinued after the first couple of weeks for now).
<br>
<br>
Most important files include: 
* `additional_vizs.ipynb` - used to generate all the main visualizations, also *contains the most important results* from the experimental study from weights&biases. 
* `thesis_table_generator.ipynb` - this is used to fetch and process the most important values from weights&biases.
* `Hessian_Tutorial.ipynb` - this is an adapted version of the example notebook of PyHessian which we use to calculate smoothness caracteristics (hessian traces, etc.)

# Results
This is a list of the most important experiments (for the most up-to-date see paper on arxiv ["SmoothNets: Optimizing CNN architecture design for differentially private deep learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04095)).

**WILL BE DONE SOON**.
